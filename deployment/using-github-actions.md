# Using GitHub actions

To run the CI/CD action:

* Ensure you have `release-containers.yml` in `/paws-data-pipeline/.github/workflows`
* Tag your code: `git tag -fa v1.4 -m "Still testing Actions"`
* Push with `git push -f --tags`

Check the [Actions](https://github.com/CodeForPhilly/paws-data-pipeline/actions) page to see the progress.
