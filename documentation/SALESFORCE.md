# Getting into Chris's Salesforce Trailhead Sandbox

Two years ago I mocked up a bunch of stuff in a Salesforce training (Trailhead) instance.   They lasted 30 days back then.  So it's gone.
My purpose was to see how non-SFDC data from other PAWS systems can be imported and associated with constituents (Salesforce Contacts) in SFDC.
The Non-Profit Success Pack (NPSP) is a set of Salesforce customizations intended to better serve Non-Profits.  
Installation of that seems to be 50/50 in this sandbox, but it serves the purpose until we revive the Saleforce thread of this project.

I have some screenshots here to help you get in and look around.  Follow along.   I don't think you can mess anything up but please try not to anyway.

Pick the Non Profit Success Pack NPSP - the one in the middle (it's the one with the Lightening Experience.. .cooler)

This is a two part step.   First click on the Contacts tab at the top.   That should bring up recently used Contacts.  If not, click around to bring up recent contacts.  It should be an option under the Contacts tab if you hover or click for the pull-down menu.

Then click on our buddy Aaron.   Fake name and address
