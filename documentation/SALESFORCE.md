# Getting into Chris's Salesforce Trailhead Sandbox

Two years ago I mocked up a bunch of stuff in a Salesforce training (Trailhead) instance.   They lasted 30 days back then.  So it's gone.
My purpose was to see how non-SFDC data from other PAWS systems can be imported and associated with constituents (Salesforce Contacts) in SFDC.
The Non-Profit Success Pack (NPSP) is a set of Salesforce customizations intended to better serve Non-Profits.  
Installation of that seems to be 50/50 in this sandbox, but it serves the purpose until we revive the Saleforce thread of this project.

I have some screenshots here to help you get in and look around.  Follow along.   I don't think you can mess anything up but please try not to anyway.
