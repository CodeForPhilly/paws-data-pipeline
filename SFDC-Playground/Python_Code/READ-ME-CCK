READ ME for CCK's Salesforce Playground Files

original work was done in 2018-2019 Winter to prove out Volunteer Data loading into SFDC Volunteers-for-Salesforce (V4S)

Additional work was done in 2020 as part of PAWS Data Pipeline Project / Code for Philly

Original approach was to use Volgistics data (from 2018-ish timeframe), massage it via excel, load into SFDC via Data Import Wizard.

Need to match names in to Volgistics data (hours entries are by "ID" not person name).   

See the xlsx "Service Shifts Working File ....."

Loading into SFDC requires creating: 
Contacts (people), 
Campaigns (Volunteer Campaigns)  and 
Volunteer Jobs (tied to Vol Campaigns)


2020 work progressed into using the SFDC API.   
Seeking to create through APIs as next step.
