                        The PAWS data pipeline (PDP) is community-driven and developed software that serves the
                        Philadelphia Animal Welfare Society (PAWS), Philadelphiaâ€™s largest animal rescue partner
                        and no-kill animal shelter. It is a project that began on Nov 24, 2019 and is being built
                        through a volunteer effort coordinated by Code for Philly. PDP is free and open source
                        software. The volunteers that have worked on this project come from diverse backgrounds,
                        but are connected through a shared love for animals and a passion for technology.
