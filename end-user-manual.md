## How to use the pipeline?

On a regular basis (e.g. weekly), at a cadence specified by PAWS, the data pipeline runs a refresh of all the automated data sources (ShelterLuv, Salesforce). Every time it runs, matches will be re-assessed and foster data updated. In order to update volunteer data as well, the volunteer data needs to be manually exported from Volgistics and uploaded into the data pipeline prior to its next run.

## Where to access the pipeline?

Log in to the pipeline here: [https://test.pawsdp.org/](https://test.pawsdp.org/)

## How to log in?

New users are created through a PAWS admin user (contact PAWS staff). Resetting passwords will also be done through a PAWS admin user, where the PAWS admin will set a new password for the user. Contact PAWS staff for assistance.

## How to update data?



### Volgistics:

* Log in to Volgistics, go to Print -> Table Style Reports -> Excel Spreadsheet -> "All volunteer information (stock)"
* When the report is done, an email will appear in the Volgistics Mailbox with the subject "All volunteer information (stock)"; clicking on this message will save the excel file to your computer
* Go to the pipeline website, log in as admin, go to "Admin" tab, select the volgistics file from your Downloads, and click Upload
* Upload can take a few minutes; when the upload is done, there is no immediate feedback; navigate to a different tab and then back to the Admin tab to see if the "Last Updated" date was refreshed
